# DeterministicFiniteAutomaton

The application for transforming a regular grammar into an equivalent finite automaton allows users to manage and manipulate regular grammars and finite automata. Using this application, users can read a regular grammar from a file, verify its validity, generate words according to the grammar rules, and transform the grammar into a finite automaton. The application provides functions for checking whether a word is accepted by the generated finite automaton, enabling users to explore and test the properties of the language generated by the grammar.

The application is structured into several source code files, each having a specific role in implementing the functionality. The Grammar class, defined in the files Gramatica.h and Gramatica.cpp, handles operations related to the regular grammar. The class members include non-terminal symbols (Vn), terminal symbols (Vt), the start symbol (S), and productions (P). The main methods of the Grammar class include verifying the grammar, generating words, and displaying the grammar in a readable format.

The FiniteAutomaton class, defined in the files FiniteAutomaton.h and FiniteAutomaton.cpp, handles operations related to the finite automaton. The class members include the set of states (Q), the alphabet (Σ), the transition function (δ), the initial state (S), and the set of accept states (F). The main methods of the FiniteAutomaton class include verifying the automaton, checking if it is deterministic, verifying word acceptance, and displaying the automaton in a readable format.

The file Gramatici.cpp contains the main function and manages the user interaction with the application. The main function includes an interactive menu that allows the user to select various options, such as displaying the grammar, generating words, obtaining and displaying the equivalent automaton, and verifying word acceptance by the automaton. The Transformation function in this file transforms the regular grammar into an equivalent finite automaton, utilizing the members and methods of the FiniteAutomaton class.

Interaction with the application is done through a command-line menu. The user can choose to display the grammar, generate words, obtain and display the finite automaton, and verify word acceptance by the automaton. The application provides appropriate feedback based on the selected actions, thus facilitating the exploration and testing of the properties of the language generated by the grammar. The application is designed to be extensible and modular, allowing for the addition of new functionalities or modifications of existing ones without affecting the core structure of the code.
